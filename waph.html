        <h1>Course Description</h1>
    
    <p>In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

    <h2>Topics (Tentative):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Web and Web Application</li>
        <li>Client-side Web Development with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
        <li>Server-side Web Application Development with PHP and Database (MySQL)</li>
        <li>Version control (git) and DevOps</li>
        <li>Web Application Security: Vulnerabilities and Attacks with Hands-on Exercises</li>
        <li>Secure Web Programming Principles and Practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Goals and Objectives:</h2>
    <p>Students will have the ability to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Obtain the ability and skills to effectively use state-of-the-art techniques in web application development and security tools for the analysis, design, and implementation of secure web systems</li>
        <li>Enhance students’ programming skills to develop secure, robust, sustainable software products</li>
        <li>Establish security analysis skills to identify and avoid potential web vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Identify the types of security threats and perform attacks in web applications and adopt corresponding countermeasures to prevent such attacks</li>
        <li>Obtain the ability and skills to apply practical knowledge of security in designing and implementing web applications with contemporary programming technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Outcomes:</h2>
    <p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design, implement, and evaluate a web-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline</li>
        <li>Understand the principle aspects of concepts of web application security</li>
        <li>Identify and discuss the types of security threats and attacks in web applications and practical experience with hands-on exercises</li>
        <li>Adopt corresponding countermeasures to identified threats in web applications and argue their effectiveness</li>
        <li>Apply practical knowledge of security in designing and implementing web applications with contemporary technologies</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Lab-0 Overview</h2>
        <p>This lab homework is covered in Lecture 2, with included homework of Lecture 1. In Part I, I deploy an Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine on the provided online environment and install software and applications. In Part II, i clone the course repository and my private repository using the ssh key,which are used as axcess to clone the private repository the basic operations are performed on git using push,pull and commit. A README file has been creted using the course README templete to build the own profile and complete git exercises to write the report using the pandoc application installed in the ubuntu terminal.</p>

        <h2>Lab-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>Lab-1 gives an idea about how the request and response from an web application occurs, this lab particualarly concentrated on the http request and hhtp response. The tool we used to record the request and respond messege is wireshark.After that, we went through creating a c file and compiling it through gcc and converting the c file into a cgi. Then after we deal with some front end commands like echo, curl and generated some php files and run them through the localhost. This lab gives us the foundational knowledge about how the web application work and how user can interact with the web in different ways.</p>

        <h2>Lab-2 Overview</h2>
        <p>The lab starts with the basic blocks of the front-end scripting languages and goes into the medium level. The labs contain tasks like developing the HTML page with basic html tags related to forms, images, and basic tags for writing text. Then JavaScript comes into the HTML webpage to include the digital clock and analog clock. Also, we learnt about using the JavaScript code to show and hide the user details like email or name as user required. In coming to task 2, It concentrates on Ajax, where the input, button and div elements were introduced to get user inputs from buttons and div elements to divide the page into sub sections for better representation and productivity. We deal with Ajax GET requests to the “echo.php “like the lab1 assignment. The response from the network was observed using the browser. It shows how the request and response works in Ajax. Then after we imported the CSS style from the W3schools to apply it to our own web page. This also includes the jQuery GET and POST attributes to observe the request from user and response from the server. We used the jQuery Ajax functions to achieve the desired results. The last part of the lab deals with the inclusion of third-party APIs into the web page, where Ajax and JSON object values are used to include the programming joke API into the web page. Finally, we used the fetch function to include the function to guess the user age with user’s name as response and guessed age from the response in the web page.</p>

        <h2>Hackathon-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>This hackthon contains two tasks. Task 1 deals with the cross-site scripting attacks on the website created by the professor for this assignment. There are 7 levels of attacks for this assignment, and the level of security increases with each level. We need to inject the XSS to display our name using the alert() function. From levels 2 to 6, we need to guess the code where the vulnerability of the web site is exploited. In coming to task two, we need to deal with the input validation and XSS defence methods. In task 2.a, we need to revise the echo.php file from Lab2 to validate the user data, and the same is true for HTML and JSON codes in Lab2.</p>

        <h2>Individual Project-1 Overview </h2>
        <p>The individual project-1 overview was to develop a student-oriented page to showcase skills and work done for the "WAPH" course.
            <br> 1. This project includes the resume of the student.
            <br> 2. The external API is used to display on our HTML page.
            <br> 3. We are encouraged to use certain open-source CSS and JavaScript frameworks on our HTML page.
            <br> 4. The course work links also need to be included on the web page.</p>
